# Priority Queue Algorithms

## Available Algorithms

### 1. Default Priority Algorithm
Simple algorithm based on urgency and importance flags:
- Urgent tasks: +50 points
- Important tasks: +30 points
- Due date proximity: Variable bonus

### 2. Eisenhower Matrix Algorithm
Four-quadrant prioritization:
- **Quadrant 1** (Urgent + Important): Priority 100
- **Quadrant 2** (Not Urgent + Important): Priority 75
- **Quadrant 3** (Urgent + Not Important): Priority 50
- **Quadrant 4** (Not Urgent + Not Important): Priority 25

### 3. Time Decay Algorithm
Priority increases as due date approaches:
- Overdue tasks: Exponential increase
- Near-term tasks: Higher priority
- Long-term tasks: Base priority

## Future Algorithms

### ML-Based Algorithm
- Train models on user behavior
- Learn from task completion patterns
- Adaptive prioritization based on context

### Analytics-Driven Algorithm
- Historical completion times
- Resource availability
